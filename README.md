## 📊 Dashboard Features

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Crashes** | Displays the total number of recorded airplane crashes (`160`). |
| **Highest Fatalities in a Single Crash** | Shows the deadliest single crash incident (`98` fatalities). |
| **Average Fatalities per Crash Across Locations** | A heat map visualizing average fatalities by region. High-impact zones include Asia, Europe, and parts of Africa. |
| **Total Ground Fatalities by Location** | Pie chart highlighting ground fatalities across key crash sites like Lviv (Ukraine), Bangui (CAR), and Da Nang (Vietnam). |
| **Yearly Trend of Crashes** | Line graph showing annual crash trends, indicating spikes during historical events (e.g., wars). |
| **Aircraft Types Involved** | Bar chart of aircraft models most frequently involved in crashes, including the Douglas C-47 and Lockheed P-38. |
| **Crash Frequency by Fatality Count and Registration** | Analysis of crash frequency by registration and fatality level. |
| **Airlines with the Highest Number of Crashes** | Breakdown of crashes by airline/operator, with military operators being the most represented. |
| **Annual Trends in Onboard vs Ground Fatalities** | Stacked bar chart comparing onboard and ground fatalities over time. |
| **Passenger Count by Route and Fatalities** | Bar graph showing passenger loads and associated fatalities on specific routes. |
